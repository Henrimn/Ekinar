# Ekinar With Beggar
A Proxy Server For Vindictus World Server.

## Beggar
Beggar is here to read NX Hash from Nexon Launcher and use it to launch Vindictus.exe with proper launch options.

## Ekinar
Ekinar acts as a web server that can host EndPoint.txt, and a proxy server at the same time. It is a kind of bridge between Vindictus client and official server. All packets that were sent by Vindictus client will be forwarded to official server by Ekinar. Therefore, by using Ekinar, these sent/received packets from both sides can be read/edited and passed to another application.

## Requirements
* .NET 4.6.1 or above
