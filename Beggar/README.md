# Beggar

## How to use
- Put Beggar.exe into the game folder (which has Vindictus.exe).
- Start Beggar.
- Press the Play button on Nexon Launcher, then Beggar will handle the rest.

## How it works
- Beggar will make a copy of itself and name it Vindictus.exe. When play button on Nexon Launcher is pressed, Beggar will read launch options, write needed strings to system hosts file to redirect Vindictus to Ekinar. Finally run Vindictus.exe with the correct launch options.

##To-do list:
- Test with Garena Launcher.
